    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These moist banana chocolate chip muffins are easy to make whenever you have some ripe bananas. They're my kids' favorite homemade treat â€” they love to see who gets the most chocolate chips in a muffin!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup mashed bananas</li>
            <li>3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners. </li>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix oil, yogurt, egg, and vanilla together in a separate bowl until well combined; stir into flour mixture until smooth. Gently fold in mashed bananas and chocolate chips. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 22 to 25 minutes. Cool briefly in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
